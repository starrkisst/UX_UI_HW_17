                <p>Hi, I’m Amber! I’m  a senior level graphic designer with a strong foundation in print media. I have always had a passion for community, for serving and for the welfare and betterment of others. Since I was young, I have been creating. From studying ecological design principles in permaculture to earning my degree and then having a career in graphic design, I have observed patterns in nature, in people and in design that mirror each other. I’m excited to transition into a design field that prioritizes  solving problems for users while also being aesthetically pleasing, cohesive, and current. This field blends my love for serving people with my love for design, and I look forward to the opportunity to serve people with this new skill.</p>
